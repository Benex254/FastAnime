> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This project currently scrapes allanime and is in no way related to them. The site is in the public domain and can be access by any one with a browser.

> [!NOTE]

> The docs are still being worked on and are far from completion.

## Installation

The app can run wherever python can run. So all you need to have is python installed on your device.
On android you can use [termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app).
If you have any difficulty consult for help on the [discord channel](https://discord.gg/HRjySFjQ)

### Installation using your favourite package manager

Currently the app is only published on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/fastanime/).
The app is published approximately after every 14 days, which will include accumulative changes during that period.

#### Using pipx

Preferred method of installation since [Pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) creates an isolated environment for each app it installs.

```bash

pipx install fastanime
```

#### Using pip

```bash
pip install fastanime
```

### Installing the bleeding edge version

To install the latest build which are created on every push by GitHub actions, download the [fastanime_debug_build](https://github.com/Benex254/FastAnime/actions) of your choosing from the GitHub actions page.
Then:

```bash
unzip fastanime_debug_build

# outputs fastanime<version>.tar.gz

pipx install fastanime<version>.tar.gz

# --- or ---

pip install fastanime<version>.tar.gz
```

### Building from the source

Requirements:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [python 3.10 and above](https://www.python.org/)
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

To build from the source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Benex254/FastAnime.git`
2. Navigate into the folder: `cd FastAnime`
3. Then build and Install the app:

```bash
# Normal Installation
poetry build
cd dist
pip install fastanime<version>.whl

# Editable installation (easiest for updates)
# just do a git pull in the Project dir
# the latter will require rebuilding the app
pip install -e .
```

4. Enjoy! Verify installation with:

```bash
fastanime --version
```

> [!Tip]
>
> Download the completions from [here](https://github.com/Benex254/FastAnime/tree/master/completions) for your shell.
> To add completions:
>
> - Fish Users: `cp $FASTANIME_PATH/completions/fastanime.fish ~/.config/fish/completions/`
> - Bash Users: Add `source $FASTANIME_PATH/completions/fastanime.bash` to your `.bashrc`
> - Zsh Users: Add `source $FASTANIME_PATH/completions/fastanime.zsh` to your `.zshrc`

### External Dependencies

The only required external dependency, unless you won't be streaming, is [MPV](https://mpv.io/installation/), which i recommend installing with [uosc](https://github.com/tomasklaen/uosc) and [thumbfast](https://github.com/po5/thumbfast) for the best experience since they add a better interface to it.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The project currently sees no reason to support any other video
> player because we believe nothing beats **MPV** and it provides
> everything you could ever need with a small footprint.
> But if you have a reason feel free to encourage as to do so.

**Other dependencies that will just make your experience better:**

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) :fire: which is used as a better alternative to the ui.
- [chafa](https://github.com/hpjansson/chafa) currently the best cross platform and cross terminal image viewer for the terminal.
- [icat](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/icat/) an image viewer that only works in [kitty terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), which is currently the best terminal in my opinion, and by far the best image renderer for the terminal thanks to kitty's terminal graphics protocol. Its terminal graphics is so op that you can [run a browser on it](https://github.com/chase/awrit?tab=readme-ov-file)!!
- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is used as the preview script language.
- [ani-skip](https://github.com/synacktraa/ani-skip) :fire: used for skipping the opening and ending theme songs

## Usage

The app offers both a graphical interface (under development) and a robust command-line interface.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The GUI is mostly in hiatus; use the CLI for now.
> However, you can try it out before i decided to change my objective by checking out this [release](https://github.com/Benex254/FastAnime/tree/v0.20.0).
> But be reassured for those who aren't terminal chads, i will still complete the GUI for the fun of it

#### The anilist command :fire: :fire: :fire:

Stream, browse, and discover anime efficiently from the terminal using the [AniList API](https://github.com/AniList/ApiV2-GraphQL-Docs).

##### Running without any subcommand

Run `fastanime anilist` to access the main interface.

##### Subcommands

The subcommands are mainly their as convenience. Since all the features already exist in the main interface.

- `fastanime anilist trending`: Top 15 trending anime.
- `fastanime anilist recent`: Top 15 recently updated anime.
- `fastanime anilist search`: Search for anime (top 50 results).
- `fastanime anilist upcoming`: Top 15 upcoming anime.
- `fastanime anilist popular`: Top 15 popular anime.
- `fastanime anilist favourites`: Top 15 favorite anime.
- `fastanime anilist random`: get random anime

The following are commands you can only run if you are signed in to your AniList account:

- `fastanime anilist watching`
- `fastanime anilist planning`
- `fastanime anilist rewatching`
- `fastanime anilist dropped`
- `fastanime anilist paused`
- `fastanime anilist completed`

Plus: `fastanime anilist notifier` :fire:

```bash
# basic form
fastanime anilist notifier

# with logging to stdout
fastanime --log anilist notifier

# with logging to a file. stored in the same place as your config
fastanime --log-file anilist notifier
```

The above commands will start a loop that checks every 2 minutes if any of the anime in your watch list that are aireing has just released a new episode.

The notification will consist of a cover image of the anime in none windows systems.

You can place the command among your machines startup scripts.

For fish users for example you can decide to put this in your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
if ! ps aux | grep -q '[f]astanime .* notifier'
  echo initializing fastanime anilist notifier
  nohup fastanime --log-file anilist notifier>/dev/null &
end
```

> To sign in just run `fastanime anilist login` and follow the instructions.
> To view your login status `fastanime anilist login --status`

#### download subcommand

Download anime to watch later dub or sub with this one command.
Its optimized for scripting due to fuzzy matching.
So every step of the way has been and can be automated.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The download feature is powered by [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) so all the bells and whistles that it provides are readily available in the project.
> Like continuing from where you left of while downloading, after lets say you lost your internet connection.

**Syntax:**

```bash
# Download all available episodes
fastanime download <anime-title>

# Download specific episode range
# be sure to observe the range Syntax
fastanime download <anime-title> -r <episodes-start>-<episodes-end>
```

fastanime search <anime-title>

# binge all episodes with this command
fastanime search <anime-title> -

# binge a specific episode range with this command

fastanime search <anime-title> <episodes-start>-<episodes-end>
```

#### downloads subcommand

View and stream the anime you downloaded using MPV.

# to get config path which is useful if you want to use it for another program.

```

> [!Note]
